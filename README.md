![Headless WP Boilerplate](static/images/logo.png)
React/Next app working with WordPress as a headless cms. (work in progress)
 
 ## v 0.2.0
 Currently I'm restructuring the header so that it actually containers the header and nav.

 v 0.3.0 The future will hold a template system within the layout component. Not sure exactly how I want this to work yet.

 ## Testing

 <code>yarn</code>
 <code>yarn dev</code>

 ## Test Production

 <code>yarn build</code>
 <code>yarn start</code>
